My app didn't quite do exactly what I wanted it to do but what was supposed to happen was that after I prompted the user to state the id of the product that they wanted to buy, it should have listed the product with the necessary information without console logging.  Next, after prompting how many units of product to buy, the app was supposed to subtract the quantity from the stock total amount if applicable.
